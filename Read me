# Digit Recognition Using MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Preprocessing of the MNIST dataset.
- Building and training a CNN model.
- Evaluating the model's performance.
- Making predictions on test images.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2.**Jupyter notebook **:

3. **Save the File**:
   - Once youâ€™re done editing, save the file as `README.md`.

4. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Add the `README.md` file to your repository using the Git commands:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README file"
     git push origin main
     ```

This should create a professional README file for your project. Let me know if you'd like help tweaking the content! ðŸš€
